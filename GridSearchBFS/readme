This gridsearch BFS takes a NxM matrix, each element of consisting of 1 of 4 values:
1 - house
2 - street
3- bus stop
4- wall

The algorithm creates a busroute class, which inherits a house class which then also inherits a point class
The algorithm then iterates through the grid using BFS to find the closest bus stop to each corresponding house,
while not going through other houses or walls.
